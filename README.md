This formbuilder is my second bigger project more or less OOP-style. It consists of a few classes representing the main input types of HTML forms. Similar input types like text and email belong to the same inputfield class. The formbuildr class/object takes the selected inputfields (that is: the created objects on the index page) and makes an HTML string of it, including form action and submit button. The validation of this form is handled procedural style on the action page. Note: the comments are in dutch.
